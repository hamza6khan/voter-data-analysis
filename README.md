# Voter Data Analysis

## Project Description
Analyzing data from the 2020 election to identify the effects income and voter barriers have on a citizen's ability to vote.

## Methods Used
* Multiple Linear Regression
* Data Visualization

## Data Used
We utilized data from [Cooperative Election Study](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910/DVN/E9N6PH) which has survey entries from 61,000 American adults. The survery was asking Americans questions that can be analyzed to understand why they did not vote in the 2020 election.

## Limitations
We were not allowed to use logistic regressions as it was outside the scope of the project. 

## Conclusions
We observed a correlation between income levels and reasons for not voting, where individuals with higher self-reported incomes were less likely to face voting barriers when compared to respondents with lower self-reported incomes. The lack of voter registration emerged as a significant impediment for those with lower incomes, potentially because lower-income individuals do not have the luxury of time to take off work to go register to vote.
